### ATTENTION: This repo will soon be deprecated in favor of this repo: https://github.com/harpwood/Chord-Diagram-Creator-for-Adobe-Illustrator

##### This version should be stable enough to use it. 

This script started simple but got a lot of features and along with the features, it also got some complexity. Looks like that a single dialog window is not enough anymore, so the next big update will have a UI revamp!

#### The documentation will be updated sometime later, because the UI is not final yet. 



### Brief instructions

Use the script *ChordDiagrams.jsx*  **in the folder *deploy***.  You can also download the script from [releases](https://github.com/harpwood/Guitar-Chord-Diagram-Generator-for-Adobe-Illustrator/releases)

**How to run a script** with Adobe illustrator : https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/automation-scripts.html#run_a_script 



This script will generate guitar chord diagrams for you on Adobe Illustrator. It is at very early stage.  More details about it and installation instructions when it will have an UI.
